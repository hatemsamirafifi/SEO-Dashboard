# In-App AI Agent (SAM)

SAM is OpenSEO's in-app SEO agent. It runs inside a Cloudflare Durable Object
via `@cloudflare/think` and calls the same shared MCP tool handlers as the MCP
server — in-process, never over HTTP, and never directly against DataForSEO.

This document describes the configuration surface added in Phases O and O2:
multi-provider model and provider settings, connection testing, bounded loops,
tool-call deduplication, and workflow presets.

## How Model Configuration Resolves

The agent resolves which provider and model to run on every turn, in this
order:

1. **Project settings** (project settings page → AI agent section) — applies
   only when the project has a non-inheriting row saved.
2. **Organization settings** (Settings page → AI agent section) — the global
   default for all projects.
3. `AI_AGENT_PROVIDER` + `AI_AGENT_MODEL` environment variables (provider must
   be one of `openrouter | openai | gemini | anthropic`; anything else is
   ignored).
4. The chosen provider's own fallback model env var (`OPENROUTER_MODEL`,
   `OPENAI_MODEL`, `GEMINI_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`).
5. Built-in defaults per provider (`openrouter` → `minimax/minimax-m3`,
   `openai` → `gpt-5`, `gemini` → `gemini-2.5-flash`, `anthropic` →
   `claude-sonnet-4-5`).

When no settings row and no `AI_AGENT_PROVIDER` exist, the default provider is
**openrouter**, which preserves the pre-O2 single-provider behavior.

A settings row only counts when **both** provider and model are set. Model ids
are validated against the selected provider's pattern (see
`validateModelForProvider` in `providers.ts`); an invalid pair is rejected at
save time, and a settings row whose model doesn't match its provider (for
example from an older save) is normalized at runtime to the provider's default
model instead of being sent to the wrong API. Clearing a project's model
override removes the row entirely, so the project inherits the
organization/environment default again.

## Configuration Scopes & Editable Credentials (Phase S)

AI configuration resolves per field across three scopes, **provider-aware**:

```text
Project row → Organization row → Environment → Built-in default
```

Each scope row (`ai_agent_settings`, one per scope) persists:

- `provider` + `model` (as before),
- `base_url` — plaintext endpoint override (OpenAI-Compatible / Ollama Cloud
  only; honored only when the row's provider is the effective one),
- `credentials` — an **encrypted** JSON map `{providerId: apiKey}` (AES-GCM
  via better-auth's `symmetricEncrypt`, keyed from
  `AI_CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` or `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, domain-separated
  as `:ai-credentials-v1` so it can never be cross-decrypted with OAuth
  tokens). Plaintext keys are never returned by any GET, never logged, and
  never reach the browser; the UI shows masked suffixes and explicit
  Change/Remove actions, with "blank = do not modify" semantics.

Provider-aware credential fallback — a scope's key is used **only for its own
provider**: project(OpenAI Compatible, custom Base URL) + organization key for
the same provider → combined; a Gemini project never inherits an OpenAI key
(→ falls back to the Gemini environment key, or "Not configured").

- **Environment defaults** are read-only in the UI (shown on the
  organization page); the browser never edits deployment env vars.
- **Test Connection** always tests the current edit state (unsaved provider/
  key/Base URL/model round-trip over TLS, never persisted), falling back to
  the effective configuration for untouched fields.
- **Refresh Models** bypasses the 12h catalog cache and re-fetches;
  catalogs are cached per **provider + normalized Base URL**, so two
  gateways never share a cached catalog.
- **Use inherited settings** deletes the scope row; the parent scope (or
  environment) becomes effective immediately.
- SAM resolves the same effective configuration before each turn — saved
  changes apply to future turns while existing conversations stay intact.
- Deployments without a configured encryption key (neither env var set)
  cannot store credentials; env fallback keeps working and the UI explains
  the gap.

## Provider Support

OpenSEO supports multiple AI providers, including OpenRouter, OpenAI, Google
Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, and Ollama Cloud. Provider
availability depends on configuration and model capabilities.

Adapters live in `provider-adapters.ts`, shared helpers in
`provider-shared.ts`, contract + registry in `providers.ts`; the `AiProvider`
interface lets another provider slot in without touching the agent or the UI:

| Provider          | Key env var                                                  | Model env var             | Built-in model           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| OpenRouter        | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`                                         | `OPENROUTER_MODEL`        | `minimax/minimax-m3`     |
| OpenAI            | `OPENAI_API_KEY`                                             | `OPENAI_MODEL`            | `gpt-5`                  |
| Google Gemini     | `GEMINI_API_KEY`                                             | `GEMINI_MODEL`            | `gemini-2.5-flash`       |
| Anthropic         | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`                                          | `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`         | `claude-sonnet-4-5`      |
| OpenAI Compatible | `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` (+ `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL`) | `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini`            |
| Ollama Cloud      | `OLLAMA_API_KEY` (+ optional `OLLAMA_CLOUD_BASE_URL`)        | `OLLAMA_CLOUD_MODEL`      | `qwen3-coder:480b-cloud` |

### OpenAI-Compatible endpoints

Any service speaking the OpenAI chat API works through this provider:
gateways, vLLM, LM Studio, and **local Ollama** (`http://localhost:11434/v1`;
inside Docker Desktop use `http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1` — container
localhost is not the host). Configuration:

- `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL` — required; deployment configuration, shown
  read-only in Settings → AI. Trailing slashes are normalized and `/v1` is
  never duplicated.
- `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` — optional; some local gateways need none.
- Model selection via the settings UI (catalog discovery from
  `<base>/models`, with manual model entry when discovery is unavailable).

### Ollama Cloud

No local Ollama installation required. Defaults to the official cloud
endpoint (`https://ollama.com/v1`); override with `OLLAMA_CLOUD_BASE_URL`
for testing/enterprise compatibility. Tool calling and streaming work through
the same OpenAI-compatible contract.

### Base URL security

User/deployment-supplied Base URLs are validated before use: absolute
http(s) URLs only, no embedded credentials, and cloud metadata endpoints
(`169.254.169.254`, `metadata.google.internal`) are always blocked. Hosted
deployments (`AUTH_MODE=hosted`) additionally require HTTPS and reject
private/loopback targets (SSRF protection); self-hosted/local runtimes may
explicitly point at private gateways such as local Ollama.

### Data policies (Zero Data Retention)

The OpenRouter adapter routes requests to Zero-Data-Retention endpoints by
product policy. If the selected model has no ZDR-compatible endpoint,
requests fail with a clear DATA_POLICY_BLOCKED message:

> OpenRouter could not find an endpoint compatible with your current Zero
> Data Retention policy for this model. Choose a compatible model or adjust
> your OpenRouter privacy settings.

with a link to [openrouter.ai/settings/privacy](https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy).
OpenSEO never disables or works around the policy automatically, never
silently switches models, and never surfaces raw provider payloads.

Every provider supports:

- **Model catalog** — fetched from the provider's models endpoint (OpenRouter:
  `/api/v1/models`; OpenAI: `/v1/models`; Gemini: `/v1beta/models`;
  Anthropic: `/v1/models`; OpenAI-Compatible/Ollama Cloud: `<base>/models`),
  normalized to id/name/context length/pricing/tool support, and cached
  server-side in R2 for 12 hours. An unconfigured or unreachable provider
  yields an empty catalog; the UI then degrades to a manual model-id input.
  Values an endpoint does not expose stay unknown — never invented.
- **Connection test** — a minimal `generateText` with `maxOutputTokens: 8`
  plus a best-effort tool-calling probe. Failures are normalized into one
  vocabulary (AUTH_ERROR, MODEL_UNAVAILABLE, DATA_POLICY_BLOCKED,
  INVALID_BASE_URL, RATE_LIMITED, PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE, CONNECTION_TIMEOUT,
  UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE — plus TOOL_INPUT_INVALID, which SAM's tool loop can
  produce but a connection test never will) with curated user-safe messages —
  raw provider payloads, keys, and stacks never reach the UI. Missing keys
  short-circuit without calling the API.
- **Cost estimate** — real per-call USD cost when the provider reports it
  (OpenRouter via `providerMetadata.openrouter.usage.cost`); providers without
  per-call pricing report 0.

The SAM agent itself stays provider-agnostic: it receives a resolved
`{provider, model}` pair and a matching `LanguageModelV3` instance; there is no
provider-specific logic in the SAM tool layer. AI SDK version pairing note:
the app pins `ai@6.x` (required by `@cloudflare/think`'s peer range
`^6.0.182`) with `@ai-sdk/openai@3.x`, `@ai-sdk/google@3.x`, and
`@ai-sdk/anthropic@3.x`, whose chat models are `LanguageModelV3` — compatible
with ai 6's `LanguageModel` union.

## Long-Running Tools (Site Audits)

Site audits are asynchronous workflows: `run_site_audit` starts one and
returns immediately with `{auditId, state: "started"}`; results don't exist
yet at that point. The agent distinguishes a **START request** ("start an
audit" — starting it is a complete answer) from a **FINAL RESULT request**
("give me the page count / issues") and, for the latter, waits for a terminal
state through the dedicated `poll_site_audit` tool before answering.

`poll_site_audit` is agent-side orchestration around the same
`get_audit_status` handler the MCP server registers (identical D1 state,
project scoping, and dead-workflow self-heal — no state bypass):

- **Normalized states** — every read maps to
  `started | running | completed | failed | cancelled` with
  `progress: {current, total}` and `resultReady`. There is no distinct
  persisted "cancelled" state: an audit deleted mid-wait surfaces as
  NOT_FOUND → `cancelled`; a terminated workflow self-heals to `failed`.
- **Polling policy** — exponential backoff (first read immediate, then ~1s,
  ~2s, ~4s… capped), bounded by both an attempt cap and an overall
  wall-clock window.
- **Terminal behavior** — `completed` → fetch `get_audit_issues` /
  `get_audit_pages` only as the request requires; `failed`/`cancelled` →
  plain explanation, offer to retry; budget exhausted while still running →
  the agent says exactly that the audit is still running and never invents
  page counts or issues from partial progress.
- **Budget accounting** — the wait counts as ONE call toward
  `AI_AGENT_MAX_TOOL_CALLS`; its internal status reads are logged (full
  observability preserved) but are cheap OpenSEO-state reads, not paid calls,
  and cannot loop forever.
- **Single-flight** — concurrent waits in the same conversation share one
  poller per audit; terminal results are memoized per explicit audit id.
- **UX aggregation** — repeated polling collapses into one chat badge
  ("Running site audit…"), with the outcome/progress as a suffix ("complete ·
  50/50 pages"). The dedup cache never serves stale audit-status snapshots.

Polling bounds are env-tunable (defaults in `samTurnControls.ts`):

| Variable                     | Default  | Meaning                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `AI_AGENT_POLL_INITIAL_MS`   | `1000`   | First backoff delay                |
| `AI_AGENT_POLL_MAX_MS`       | `8000`   | Backoff cap between reads          |
| `AI_AGENT_MAX_POLL_ATTEMPTS` | `12`     | Max status reads per wait          |
| `AI_AGENT_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MS`   | `150000` | Overall wall-clock window per wait |

The orchestration is provider-neutral: it is plain tool logic around OpenSEO
state, with no model- or provider-specific branching.

## Bounded Loops and Cost Control

- `AI_AGENT_MAX_STEPS` (default `48`) — Think's `maxSteps` bound for a turn.
- `AI_AGENT_MAX_TOOL_CALLS` (default `24`) — a stop condition
  (`samTurnControls.ts`) that ends the turn once the cumulative number of tool
  calls across all steps reaches the cap. This is the primary cost guard:
  SEO tool calls are the paid part of a turn.
- **Tool-call dedup** (`samToolExecution.ts`) — each SAM conversation keeps a
  bounded cache (64 entries, oldest evicted) keyed by `toolName:JSON(args)`.
  An identical repeat within the same session is served from cache instead of
  hitting the router again. Errors are never cached. The cache lives on the
  Durable Object instance, so it survives across turns of one conversation but
  is lost on eviction — by design.
- **Tool event logging** — every tool execution emits a structured
  `sam-tool` JSON log line (tool, reused flag, status, duration).

The system prompt also instructs SAM to reuse already-fetched data rather than
re-requesting tools, and to treat tool outputs as untrusted data
(prompt-injection guidance).

## Tool-Input Errors vs Provider Errors (Phase V)

Two different failures can interrupt a turn, and they are classified at
different layers with different vocabularies:

- **Tool-input errors** (`TOOL_INPUT_INVALID`) — the model emitted a tool
  request whose arguments failed the tool's Zod schema validation, or named a
  tool that does not exist (`InvalidToolInputError` / `NoSuchToolError` /
  `ToolCallRepairError` from the AI SDK). The failure happens in the SDK's
  parse step, **before** `execute()` runs: no tool handler, no DataRouter, no
  provider, and no DataForSEO call happens for a rejected request.
- **Provider errors** (`UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE`, `AUTH_ERROR`, `RATE_LIMITED`, …)
  — the provider itself failed or lacks a capability.

The distinction is enforced by classification order
(`normalizeProviderError` in `providerErrors.ts`): tool-input detection runs
**first**, so a schema failure can never be labeled a provider failure. The
provider-capability match is deliberately precise — it requires both a
capability term (tool calling / function calling / tools) and a refusal term
("not supported", "does not support"), never the bare word "tool". This is
the fix for the 2026-09-02 incident, where three schema-invalid requests
(`list_saved_keywords {limit: 200}`; `get_serp_results` with bare-string and
`{q: …}` query objects) all rendered as
"ollama_cloud does not support a required feature (such as tool calling)…" —
blaming a provider that was never called.

**Model self-correction.** Within the turn, the AI SDK feeds the raw
validation diagnosis (Zod issue paths and expectations — never echoed
argument values) back to the model as the tool call's result, and the loop
continues to the next step (bounded by `AI_AGENT_MAX_STEPS` and
`AI_AGENT_MAX_TOOL_CALLS`). This is how the incident's model self-corrected
`{q: …}` to `{keyword: …}` on its third attempt. `TOOL_INPUT_INVALID` is
non-retryable in the provider sense: nothing automatically re-sends the same
invalid request; only the model's corrected arguments produce a new call.

**What the user sees.** The stream seam (`samStreamErrorGuard`, Phase U) and
the turn error hook render the curated message
("Invalid tool arguments for <tool>: <safe field-level detail>. The request
was not executed and no provider call was made.") — no provider name, no raw
payload, no stack. The client fallback (`samErrorFallbacks.ts`) maps any raw
SDK tool-input wording that escapes a seam to the same vocabulary. Tool
badges in the chat show the rejection as a failed tool call.

**Observability.** Rejections emit a structured
`sam-tool-input-error` log line (session, project, tool name, error class) —
sibling to the `sam-tool` execution events, which they can never become (they
never reach `execute()`). Raw arguments are never logged.

**Security.** The curated message carries only schema-derived facts: the tool
name, the failing field paths, and the expected types/values. Zod issue
payloads do not serialize received input values; where the SDK's validator
form echoes raw arguments ("Value: …"), that portion is stripped before the
message is composed. Stacks, secrets, headers, and provider internals never
reach the UI (Phase U invariant).

## Streaming Render Stability (Phase T2)

Multi-tool turns stream hundreds (sometimes thousands) of WebSocket chunks per
assistant message, and a single tool part can carry hundreds of KB. Each chunk
replaces the whole streamed message in the chat client's store
(`@ai-sdk/react` clones the message and the messages array on every update).
Unthrottled, the chat tree re-renders per chunk — faster than the main thread
can commit — which React 19 eventually aborts with "Maximum update depth
exceeded". Three provider-neutral client/agent-side guards prevent that:

1. **Streaming throttle** (`SamConversation.tsx`) — `useAgentChat` is passed
   `experimental_throttle: 100`, so the store notifies React at most ~10×/s
   during streaming. Text, tool-call, and badge updates coalesce at lower
   frequency **by design**; the final message always renders in full once the
   stream settles (the throttle has a trailing edge, so nothing is lost).
   This is purely a render-frequency bound — it changes nothing about server
   execution, providers, DataRouter, or MCP contracts.
2. **Chat message memoization** (`ChatMessage.tsx`) — `ChatMessage` is wrapped
   in `React.memo` with a comparator that re-renders a bubble only when its
   message object is replaced (the store clones the streaming message on
   every update, so content/tool-part/error changes always re-render), when
   its `streaming` flag flips, or when its label resolver changes. Settled
   history messages keep their references and bail out even while another
   message streams and the parent rebuilds handler props per render.
3. **Agent-side Search Console bounding** (`samGscBounding.ts`) — when SAM
   calls `get_search_console_performance`, the result is bounded to the top
   **50 rows** by GSC's clicks-descending order before it becomes a tool part
   (the public MCP tool keeps its full 1000-row product contract — only the
   agent's copy is bounded). Both the structured rows AND the text summary are
   bounded: the MCP tool's own summary tabulates every fetched row, so it is
   regenerated from the bounded rows (a compact key/clicks/impressions/CTR/
   position table) — otherwise a 1000-row text table (~200KB) would ride into
   the transcript even with bounded data. The chosen limit is based on the
   tool's own surface: the MCP text summary shows the top 15 rows, 50 rows
   covers top-queries/pages, head striking-distance analysis, and date trends
   in ~5–15KB, and the bounded note (computed from the actual returned rows —
   never invented aggregates) tells the model the returned-row click/impression
   totals and how to fetch the next slice with `startRow` or narrower filters.

All three are provider-neutral: no behavior keys off the provider or model, so
the guards hold identically for OpenRouter, OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic,
OpenAI-Compatible, and Ollama Cloud.

## Tool Surface

SAM exposes the shared MCP toolset (~23 tools), including four site-audit
tools added in Phase O: `run_site_audit`, `get_audit_status`,
`get_audit_issues`, and `get_audit_pages`. All tools keep their existing
authorization, DataRouter, cache, and budget behavior — SAM adds no new
mutation-capable tools.

## Workflow Presets

The SAM empty state offers five one-click workflow templates in addition to
the quick-question chips:

1. **Full SEO opportunity analysis** — site read + Search Console + keyword
   gaps, prioritized.
2. **Commercial keyword research** — high-intent terms with volume/difficulty
   and page placement suggestions.
3. **Competitor analysis** — SERP competitors, their coverage, and your gap
   list.
4. **Technical SEO** — site audit followed by a prioritized fix order.
5. **Executive SEO plan** — current standing, top moves, expected impact, and
   a 90-day timeline.

Note for local Docker dev: provider keys must come through `.env.docker` via
`env_file` — an `environment:` mapping in `compose.dev.yaml` would override
the env_file value with the host shell's unset variable and silently disable
the provider.

## Testing

Focused tests cover provider catalog parsing/failure classification and the
registry (`providers.test.ts`), settings resolution order, per-provider
precedence, invalid-pair validation, and key masking
(`AiSettingsService.test.ts`), the model-picker filter (`AiModelSelect.test.ts`),
dedup cache and event logging (`samToolExecution.test.ts`), env parsing
plus the tool-call counter (`samTurnControls.test.ts`), the streaming throttle
seam and large-tool-output behavior (`samStreamingThrottle.test.ts`), the
ChatMessage memo comparator (`ChatMessage.memo.test.ts`), agent-side GSC
bounding (`samGscBounding.test.ts`), the full tool-input classification
matrix including the 2026-09-02 incident reproduction through the real AI SDK
loop (`providerErrors.test.ts`, `samToolInputErrors.test.ts`), the stream
error seams (`samStreamErrorGuard.test.ts`, `samStreamErrorSeam.test.ts`),
and the client error fallbacks (`samErrorFallbacks.test.ts`). Tests mock the
provider (`fetch`, `generateText`, `MockLanguageModelV3`) and the R2 cache;
no real provider or database calls are made.
